## Intro

* I am not an enthusiastic _bash ~~stripter~~ scripter_
* bash is not suitable for every problem
* it's great tool for piping of different solutions/tools
    * works as **glue**
    * it's **swiss army knife** of every _DevOps_
* following list is not complete
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## #1 Don't forget about portability!
</section>


<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
    ### `Hello world!`

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    echo "Hello world!"
    ```

    ## wrong Wrong WRONG! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
</script>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Portable `Hello world!`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Hello world!"
```

* `env` - run a program in a modified environment
    * looks for interpreter in `$PATH`
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## #2 Stop on Error!
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Wrong Script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "start here"
VAR = "syntax error on this line"
echo "this line will be executed too"
```
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Start This Way

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit  # stop when error occurs
set -o pipefail # if not, expressions like `error here | true`
                # will always succeed
set -o nounset  # detects uninitialised variables
set -o xtrace   # prints every expression
                # before executing it (debugging)

echo "start here"
VAR = "syntax error on this line"
echo "this line is now not reachable"
```
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## #3 Enclose Vars as `"${variable}"`
</section>


<section data-markdown>
* _escaping_

* the `'"'` helps with variables with white spaces
  ```bash
  $ track="with or without you.mp3"
  $ file $track
  with:    cannot open `with' (No such file or directory)
  or:      cannot open `or' (No such file or directory)
  without: cannot open `without' (No such file or directory)
  you.mp3: cannot open `you.mp3' (No such file or directory)
  ```
</section>

<section data-markdown>
* the `'{}'` are not necessary, but are used in _bash expansion_:
    * string interpolation: 
      ```bash
      "${variable}.yml"
      ```
    * default (fallback) value: 
      ```bash
      "${variable:-something_else}"
      ```
    * string replacement: 
      ```bash
      "${variable//from/to}"
      ```
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## #4 Use `[[ expr ]]` instead of `[ expr ]`

note:
* `[[` - extension of bash
* `[` - short for `test`
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## Cool Features I.

* no need to enclose variables into quotes

  ```bash
  [[ -f ${file} ]]    # vs. [ -f "${file}" ]
  [[ $var = "joe" ]]  # vs. [ $var = "joe" ]
  ```

* support for operators `"&&"` and `"||"`  

  ```bash
  [[ ${USERNAME} == "root" && $(id -g) == 1 ]]
  ```

* string comparision with `"<"` and `">"`

  ```bash
  [[ "apple" < "banana" ]]
  ```

note:
```bash
[ $var = "joe" ]
```
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Cool Features II.

* operator `"=~"` for regex comparisions

  ```bash
  [[ ${answer} =~ ^y(es)?$ ]]
  ```
* supports _globbing_

  ```bash
  [[ ${answer} = y* ]]
  ```
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## #5 Use Modular Approach
</section>


<section data-markdown>
* write scripts in modules (not a single file)
    * easy maintenance
    * easy navigation
    * modules are separated by functionality

* script can be extended with new functionality with `source`
  ```bash
  # ...
  source "${DATADIR}/helper.sh"
  # ...
  ```
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Detect Sourcing

* detect, if the script is being run directly, or if it is just being sourced

  ```bash
  # call the func only if the script is executed directly
  if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
    main
  fi
  ```

* script can be executed normally, but if it's sourced, only the function definitions will be imported without doing anything else

<section data-markdown>
## #6 Don't Use Tools whose Functions `bash` Handles
</section>


<section data-markdown>
* one of the most common (unconscious) mistakes

* most common `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `bc`, `expr`, e.g.:
  ```bash
  size=$(du -hs images/ | awk '{print $1}')
  ```
  can be solved with bash as
  ```bash
  array=($(du -hs images/))
  size=${array[0]}
  ```
* instead of `seq 1 10` use `{1..10}`

* use `$(cmd)` instead of `cmd`
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## #7 Write Scripts so That They can be Tested
</section>


<section data-markdown>
* close everything to the function (approach)
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  main(){
      echo "Hello world!"
  }

  if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
    main
  fi
  ```

* many tools for testing in bash are available (e.g. [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats))
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bats

  @test "when new folder is created, then exit status is 0" {
    run mkdir "${dir}"
    assert_equal "${status}" 0
  }
  ```

## #8 Use Linter
</section>


<section data-markdown>
> **Lint** or a **linter**, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. It helps to increase the quality of code.
>
> -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linter_%28software%29)
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)

* Shell script analysis tool
* contains [Gallery of bad code](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/README.md#user-content-gallery-of-bad-code)
    * shows, what kind of things does ShellCheck look for
* in your Linux distro
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## #9 Use Variable Annotations
</section>

<section data-markdown>

* `readonly` - for readonly (constant) variables

  ```bash
  readonly var='immutable value'
  ```

* `local` - for local variables inside of functions

  ```bash
  _greetings(){
      local name="$1"
      printf "Hello %s!\n" "${name}"
  }
  ```
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## #10 Avoid Temporary Files
</section>


<section data-markdown>
* some commands expect filenames as params
    * pipelining does not work

* operator `&lt;()`

  ```bash
  jq .main.temp &lt;(http https://openweathermap.org)
  ```

* _here documents_

  ```bash
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
     This is
     Here
     Document.
  EOF
  ```
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## Other Tips
</section>


<section data-markdown>
* add `||` to commands expected to fail

  ```bash
  ls /root || {
    echo "Error" >&2 
    exit 1
  }
  ```
